**Note:** SPSS 24 is not available at the moment, there was a problem with the license. This issue will be resolved in the beginning of next week.

<!-- SPSS 24 is available for all users running macOS 10.10 and higher. Please follow [this link](munki://detail-spss24) to download SPSS. The SPSS 24 license installer is only available on the campus networks (wired or wireless), so make sure you are on a VU university network.
