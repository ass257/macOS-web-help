We have reverted version 2.7.112 of XQuartz because it is not compatible with ADF 2014.
Some machines have received version 2.7.112. If you need to use ADF2014, 
please uninstall XQuartz via VU Software Center and then re-install XQuartz.
You will receive version 2.7.86, which is the last version that is compatible with ADF 2014.

#### Can't uninstall XQuartz

If you cannot uninstall XQuartz because other programs need it, please also uninstall the other programs.
You can reinstall everything after XQuartz is downgraded.
